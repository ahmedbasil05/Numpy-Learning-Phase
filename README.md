# 📘 NumPy Learning Phase — Concept-by-Concept Practice

Welcome to my **NumPy learning journey** — a collection of beginner-friendly Python scripts that helped me build a strong foundation in NumPy, Python's essential library for numerical computing.

This repository is a hands-on breakdown of key NumPy concepts, focused on learning by doing — not just reading documentation or tutorials.

## 🧠 What This Repo Covers

Each file in this repo focuses on one or more core NumPy concepts, including:

- ✅ Array creation and data types  
- ✅ Indexing, slicing, and filtering  
- ✅ Mathematical and statistical operations  
- ✅ Set operations and comparisons  
- ✅ Views vs copies in memory  
- ✅ Reshaping, flattening, and transposing arrays  
- ✅ Structured arrays and sorting

All examples are short, well-commented, and beginner-friendly — ideal for anyone looking to understand **how NumPy really works** under the hood.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I created this repo to:

- Solidify my understanding of NumPy fundamentals  
- Practice each concept in isolation before applying them in projects  
- Help other beginners navigate and master NumPy with simple examples  
- Build a personal reference I can reuse or expand later  

This is **not a tutorial repo** — it's a practical **learning log** built around curiosity and consistency.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repo** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedbasil05/numpy-learning-phase.git
cd numpy-learning-phase
```

2. **Run any script** to explore that concept:

```bash
python 05_set_operations.py
```

3. All scripts are standalone — no external data required.

## 📂 File Naming Convention

Each file is numbered for recommended order of practice, but you can start anywhere:

```
01_array_creation.py
02_math_operations.py
03_indexing_and_slicing.py
...
```

Each script has inline comments to guide you.
